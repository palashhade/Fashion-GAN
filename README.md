# Fashion-GAN
A GAN model trained on the Fashion MNIST Dataset.

This project involves the development of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for the Fashion MNIST dataset.
The GAN model consists of a generator and a discriminator, both implemented using TensorFlow. 
The generator creates new images from random noise, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of these images. 
The model is trained using a custom training loop, with Adam as the optimizer. The project also includes data preprocessing steps such as scaling and batching, and implements a callback for monitoring the modelâ€™s performance. 
The end goal is to generate new fashion images that are indistinguishable from the real ones in the dataset.
